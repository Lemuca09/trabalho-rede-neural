## üîç Overview

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to predict the weekly average value of a stock portfolio composed of multiple tickers (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL). The model uses historical weekly closing prices from the last 3 years to forecast future portfolio values several weeks ahead.

Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to analyze the variance and contribution of each stock within the portfolio.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

* Download weekly historical closing prices of specified stocks via `yfinance`
* Compute weekly portfolio average price
* Data preprocessing with z-score normalization and sliding window approach
* Train and save an LSTM model to predict portfolio prices
* Model evaluation with multiple regression metrics (Huber loss, MSE, MAE, MAPE)
* Visualization of real vs predicted prices for test data and entire dataset
* Simple buy/hold/sell decision-making simulation based on model predictions
* Future forecasting for multiple weeks ahead
* PCA analysis to understand stock influence and variance contributions

---

## üì¶ Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* TensorFlow
* yfinance
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <GIT-REPO-HTTPS>
cd repo-name
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Configure tickers and parameters**
   Edit the `TICKERS` list and other variables such as `WINDOW_SIZE`, `EPOCHS`, `BATCH_SIZE`, and `FUTURE_STEPS` as needed.
   
2. **Run the script/notebook**
   The script will:

   * Download historical weekly data (last 3 years)
   * Create and preprocess the portfolio dataset
   * Train the LSTM model (or load saved model if available)
   * Evaluate and plot predictions vs real data
   * Simulate buy/hold/sell decisions based on prediction changes
   * Forecast future portfolio values
   * Perform PCA to analyze stock contributions

3. **View results**
   Plots and printed output will show prediction accuracy, portfolio simulation results, and PCA insights.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Details

* **Model architecture:**
  LSTM layer (64 units, tanh activation) ‚Üí Dropout ‚Üí Dense (64 units, ReLU) ‚Üí Dropout ‚Üí Dense (64 units, ELU) ‚Üí Dropout ‚Üí Dense (1 output)

* **Loss function:**
  Huber loss with Œ¥=0.8 (robust regression loss combining MSE and MAE benefits)

* **Training:**
  Batch size = 4, Epochs = 300 (configurable)

---

## üìä Buy/Hold/Sell Decision Logic

* The model predicts weekly portfolio values.
* A threshold percentage (default 1.5%) determines if the model suggests to buy, hold, or sell.
* The simulation starts with an initial capital (default \$1000).
* Buys and sells are made according to predicted price changes and available capital.

---

## üî¨ PCA Analysis

* PCA is performed on the scaled stock prices (excluding the portfolio average).
* The explained variance ratio shows how much each principal component captures of total variance.
* Component weights reveal the influence of each stock in principal components.
* Interpretation of principal components helps understand stock relationships and portfolio structure.

---

## üìà Visualization

* Real vs predicted portfolio values for test set and entire dataset
* Future forecast for configurable number of weeks
* Training and validation loss curves
* PCA component contributions and explained variance
